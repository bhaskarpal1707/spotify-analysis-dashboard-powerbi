## üìå Overview  
Spotify, a Swedish audio streaming giant, has become a hub for analyzing global music trends. This project builds an **advanced Power BI dashboard** on the *Spotify Global Top 50 dataset*.  

The goal was to transform raw Spotify data into **interactive visualizations** that highlight:  
- Listening habits & popularity trends  
- Explicit vs non-explicit content patterns  
- Artist dominance and hit-making consistency  
- Song duration, album types, and year-wise performance  

By leveraging **Power BI‚Äôs new DAX Query View**, I automated measure creation, saving hours of repetitive work. This approach turned the dashboard into a **professional-grade analytical tool** for music stakeholders.

## ‚ùó Business Problems  
From the stakeholder perspective (music analysts, playlist managers, marketing teams), the following challenges existed:‚Äã:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

- **No KPI Monitoring:** Difficult to track key metrics like songs, artists, popularity, or duration.  
- **Lack of Explicit vs Non-Explicit Analysis:** No insights on how explicit content performs.  
- **Song/Album Distribution Gaps:** Hard to track albums vs singles.  
- **Trend Visibility Missing:** No monthly/yearly analysis of song performance.  
- **Disconnected Artist & Song Insights:** No drill-down capability between overview, artists, and songs.  
- **Decision-Making Gaps:** Teams lacked a quick way to identify which content resonates with audiences.  

The Power BI dashboard solves all these problems by combining global datasets with advanced DAX measures.

## üõ† Project Steps  

### Step 1: Data Import  
- Imported Spotify Top 50 dataset (`CSV`) into Power BI Desktop.  
- Renamed dataset as `Top-50-world` for consistency.  

### Step 2: Traditional vs Modern Approach  
- **Old Way:** Manually creating one DAX measure at a time.  
- **New Way:** Using **DAX Query View** to define all measures in a single script.  

### Step 3: DAX Query View (Bulk Measure Creation)  
- Enabled DAX Query View under *Preview Features*.  
- Defined **30+ measures** including:  
  - KPIs (Total Songs, Distinct Songs, Distinct Artists, Avg Popularity, Avg Duration)  
  - Explicit vs Non-Explicit comparisons  
  - Artist-specific & Year-specific measures  
  - Position-based rankings (#1 Hits)

## üìä Detailed Business Insights  

1. **Explicit vs Non-Explicit:** Explicit songs formed a noticeable share, but non-explicit songs dominated global reach.

4. **Popularity Trends:** Popularity fluctuated by month and year, reflecting seasonality in global listening.  
5. **Album Type:** Singles had higher presence compared to full albums.  
6. **#1 Hits Analysis:** Only select artists managed repeated #1 rankings, a key factor for Spotify promotions.  
7. **Year-Wise Trends:** Newer years showed higher song diversity but not always higher popularity.
